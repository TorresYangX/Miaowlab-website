I am a Research Assistant in Data Science at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), supervised by Prof. Ning Miao. I previously obtained my BEng degree in Artificial Intelligence from Nanjing University. My research focus lies in Agentic AI, with a particular emphasis on Self-Evolving Agents and Deep Research Agents. I also closely follow advancements in non-autoregressive methods (e.g., Diffusion LLMs) and Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning.
