I will begin my PhD studies in Data Science at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) in Fall 2026, under the supervision of Prof. Ning Miao. I received my BEng degree in Computer Science and Technology from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (China) and the University of Liverpool (United Kingdom) in 2023. I then obtained my MSc degree in Integrated Machine Learning Systems from University College London (UCL) in 2024. My research interests lie in reasoning in large language models, with a particular focus on reward mechanisms.
