I am an incoming PhD student in Data Science at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), advised by Prof. Ning Miao. I am currently completing my BEng degree in Computer Science and Technology at Fudan University, and I am expected to graduate in Fall 2026. My research interests focus on reasoning in large language models, particularly reinforcement learning–based approaches for improving reasoning capabilities. I am also interested in diffusion large language models.
