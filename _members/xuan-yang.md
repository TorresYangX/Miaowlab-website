I am a first year PhD student in Data Science at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), advised by Prof. Ning Miao. Before that, I earned my BEng degree at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) majoring in Computer Science. My research interests focus on reasoning in large language models, with particular emphasis on the principles and explainability of their underlying mechanisms.
