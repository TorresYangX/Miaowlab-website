Hi! I’m currently a Research Assistant at Miaow Lab. I got my BEng degree from Beihang University (BUAA). My research focuses on enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, particularly in mathematical reasoning. I am also deeply interested in novel model architectures and training methods.
